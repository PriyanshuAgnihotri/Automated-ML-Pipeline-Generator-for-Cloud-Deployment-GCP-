# Automated ML Pipeline Generator for GCP Deployment

This project provides a framework for creating automated machine learning pipelines that can be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Features

- **Pipeline Design with Configs**: YAML templates define each stage (data preprocessing, training, validation, deployment)
- **Model Integration**: Supports multiple ML models (TensorFlow, XGBoost, Scikit-learn)
- **Automation Scripts**: Python + PyTest for automated execution and testing
- **GCP Integration**: Cloud Storage, AI Platform, and Cloud Functions
- **Automated Deployment**: Models are automatically deployed to AI Platform after validation
